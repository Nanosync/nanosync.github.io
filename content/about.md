Hi there! :wave:

I'm **Benedict**, a Software Engineer. This site is dedicated to my personal blog for engineering findings, tips and tricks, and is additionally a portfolio for my projects.

I started this site as a way to learn about static site generators (SSG), and to upgrade the previous version of my website which I wrote entirely using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

To learn more about my professional experience, feel free to visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benedictpak/) profile.
